# Initial Concept

The user has an RTF document about raising baby chicks for their first 8 weeks. They want to convert this into an interactive webapp that end users can use to follow through their daily and weekly tasks while raising new baby chicks.

**Core Goals:**
- Provide guidance for healthy, proven methods on safely raising chicks
- Help users track daily and weekly tasks during the 8-week raising period
- Include fun elements like naming chicks, storing photos of each chick's growth
- Create an experience that is both useful and enjoyable to use
- Support users in raising chicks to be the best little chickens they can be

## Vision Statement
An interactive Progressive Web App that guides chicken keepers through the critical first 8 weeks of raising baby chicks, combining proven care methods with delightful features that make the journey memorable and rewarding.
