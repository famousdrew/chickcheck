## User Experience Principles

### Calm & Actionable Error Handling
When users encounter issues or health concerns:

- Present information matter-of-factly without alarming language
- Lead with the action, not the problem
- Provide clear, numbered steps for resolution
- Include reassurance that most issues are common and manageable
- Avoid words like "emergency," "danger," or "critical" unless truly warranted

**Example:**
> "Noticed some sticky fluff on a chick's bottom? That's pasty butt—super common in the first week. Here's how to help:"
> 1. Dampen a soft cloth with warm water
> 2. Gently clean the affected area
> 3. Dry thoroughly before returning to brooder
